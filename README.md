# Random-Daily-Asana

I wanted a service to choose a random number so threw together a script calling Random.org, which requires an API key.

I use https://github.com/RandomOrg/JSON-RPC-Python.

User must provide folders with yoga asanas (in .jpg or .png) as well as changing the Desktop location to copy the random asana to.
